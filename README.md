# Design Report

## Design Decisions
Initially the design of the webpage was going to be a minimalist style, but on due to some difficulties and the style not fitting with the modern traditionalistic style of the upscale chai cafe. So I settled for a more modern but still somewhat minimalistic style for the website.

## Challenges
Their were multiple small challenges with making this website, but the main issue I faced was scaling and aligning the images, due to the fact that these are stock images, their resolution and scale were all different, thus making them approximately the same size and still retain image clarity was a significant challenge that took me the most time to resolve.

Another issue that took me some time was taking the form data then converting into a JSON object, then using a POST request with a dummy api call to simulate database connectivity.

Beyond that there were some minor roadbumps, like designing the page as well as the hamburger menu along with getting the animations just right.
